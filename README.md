Hey Sebastian, I updated all the files, but no changes were made since the ones I put in a few hours a go have just been working server side, I updated this file in hopes you will see the commit log. All the 3 main files are upto date.



We are currently trying to figure out how we want the patient search to work, right now I treat Patient ID as a unique Identifier for the patient, so if I do not find them under that under it was just returning back no patient list; the problem comes if they send first name + last name combo and possibility of dob. Considering having two separate types of requests.

I have also realized that I need to change the call for return on patient ID to make it not search I guess. I have a few projects to work on today and will be working on both today and probably thoughout the weekend. I will continue updating after I make any changes that I want to keep, and if you want to test with our backend you can test @ https://dev.cardiopulse.net/DoctorMate/
